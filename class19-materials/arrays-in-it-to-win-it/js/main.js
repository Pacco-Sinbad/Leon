//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let bestMovies = ["stripes","History of the world part 1","monsters inc."]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let billMurray = bestMovies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let movieArrLength = bestMovies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = bestMovies[bestMovies.length - 1]
